# Analyzing the Effects of Space Flight on Telomere Length Dynamics in NASA Astronauts

Space remains a great frontier for humanity, with an array of dangers to human health. As part of my Ph.D, I'm researching how spaceflight affects human health. Specifically, I examine how spaceflight aboard the International Space Station effects telomeres, the structural ends of human DNA, in the blood of NASA's astronauts. My research marks, to the best of my knowledge, the *first look at the changes to telomeres in unrelated astronauts as a result of spaceflight*, building upon my lab's prior work on the effects of spaceflight in the Twins, Mark and Scott Kelly: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6436/eaau8650

This repository details the context of my research in the wide pursuit of space travel, a brief overview of my laboratory methods, and an extensive walkthrough of my analyses on telomere length data in astronauts. This repository may serve as an accessory to my lab's upcoming publications on the effects of spaceflight in unrelated astronauts.
