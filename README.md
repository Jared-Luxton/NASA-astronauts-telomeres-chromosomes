# Analyzing the Effects of Space Flight on Telomere Length Dynamics in NASA Astronauts

In progress 6/2/19 

Space remains a great frontier for humanity, with an array of dangers to human health. As part of my Ph.D research, I'm seeking to understand how spaceflight affects human health. I answer these questions from the perspective of telomeres, the structural ends of human DNA. This repository details the context of my research,
