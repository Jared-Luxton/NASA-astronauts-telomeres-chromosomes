# Analyzing the Effects of Space Flight on Telomere Length Dynamics in NASA Astronauts

Space remains a great frontier for humanity, with an array of dangers to human health. As part of my Ph.D, I'm researching how spaceflight impacts human health. Specifically, I examine how spaceflight aboard the International Space Station affects telomeres, the structural ends of human DNA, in the blood of NASA's astronauts. My research marks the *first look at the changes to telomeres in unrelated astronauts as a result of spaceflight*.

This repository details: the context of my research in the wider pursuit of space exploration, a brief overview of my laboratory methods, and an extensive walkthrough of my analyses in Python on telomere length data in astronauts. This repository may serve as an accessory to our upcoming publications on the effects of spaceflight in unrelated astronauts.
