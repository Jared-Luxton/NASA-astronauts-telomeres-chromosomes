# Analyzing the Effects of Space Flight on Telomere Length Dynamics in NASA Astronauts
  
In 2024 NASA will execute Project Artemis, sending humans back to the moon to establish a permanent lunar base. However, space is inherently dangerous to human health. As part of my Ph.D, I'm researching how spaceflight impacts human health, and whether these impacts could potentially comprise current (Project Artemis) or future missions, ala Mars and beyond. Specifically, I'm examining how time aboard the International Space Station affects telomeres, the ends of human DNA, and the stability of DNA, for NASA's astronauts. My research takes the *first look at the changes to telomeres in unrelated astronauts as a result of spaceflight*, informing NASA policy and approach for current and future missions.

This repository details the context of my research in the wider pursuit of space exploration; a brief overview of my laboratory methods; and an extensive walkthrough of my analysis using Python on telomere length data in astronauts. This repository may serve as an accessory to our upcoming publications. The walkthrough below is intended for those interested in the science and in the code. A Jupyter notebook will be provided as an accessory.

## Background 
**Health Risks and Obstacles to Space Flight**\
Did you know that NASA is sending humans to the Moon in 2024? Not only that, this mission is the first of many that will develop permanent lunar colonies. Dubbed Artemis, the NASA project entails sending the *first* woman (and another man) to the lunar surface and the development of a *permanent lunar outpost called the Gateway* orbiting the Moon. The objectives undertaken by Artemis are part of NASA's overarching goal (and humanity's common dream) for humans to explore our solar system, including Mars and beyond. 

The immediate challenges facing Artemis are substantial in terms of technology and health considerations for the astronauts. Even as we approach Project Artemis in 2024 and beyond, the short- and long-term health effects of spaceflight, especially those from chronic exposure to galactic cosmic rays, a type of radiation unique to space and not found on Earth, remain relatively unknown. Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are highly energetic particles hurtling through space at nearly the speed of light. Though a rare event, when GCRs strike human cells they shred all cellular contents in their path, including DNA. This damage accumulates over time, and could lead to degen..

process of cellular damage by GCRs is iterative, and over time could lead to tissue degeneration and/or cancer. At this time we simply don't understand how much cellular damage is accumulated for humans in space, and how it influences cancer risk. Not understanding these key issues makes addressing them impossible. These essential topics are addressed by my research on telomeres (the ends of DNA) and DNA stability for NASA astronauts aboard the International Space Station.

Telomeres are repetitive sequences of DNA encapsulated by protein and RNA found at the ends of chromosomes.
