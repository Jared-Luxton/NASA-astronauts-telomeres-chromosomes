# Analyzing the Effects of Space Flight on Telomere Length Dynamics in NASA Astronauts
  
Space remains a great frontier for humanity, with an array of dangers to human health. As part of my Ph.D, I'm researching how spaceflight impacts human health. Specifically, I examine how spaceflight aboard the International Space Station affects telomeres, the structural ends of human DNA, in the blood of NASA's astronauts. My research takes the *first look at the changes to telomeres in unrelated astronauts as a result of spaceflight*, informing NASA policies on future manned missions.

This repository details the context of my research in the wider pursuit of space exploration; a brief overview of my laboratory methods; and an extensive walkthrough of my analysis using Python on telomere length data in astronauts. This repository may serve as an accessory to our upcoming publications.
